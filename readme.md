## Usage

The main functionality of the application is contained in the `AI_mail.py` script. The script uses the `os` module and `python-dotenv` to securely access your email password, and the `ChatOllama` and `OllamaEmbeddings` classes for AI functionalities.

The `check_for_new_emails` function is where the main logic of the application resides.
